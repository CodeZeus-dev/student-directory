# Student Directory #

The Student Directory ruby script (directory.rb) enables the user to manage the list/directory of students that are currently enrolled at the Villains Academy :smiling_imp:.

The script contains a class called *StudentDirectory*, an instance of which is a student directory on its own. The class has its own methods for displaying, editing, loading, saving, and even exiting the current student directory, and all that is accomplished through an interactive menu that is shown to the user upon defining a new StudentDirectory class instance.

Enjoy!

## How to use ##

Once in the terminal, run the script by using the following ruby command,

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```

Make sure to be in the right directory before running the command. For instance, if the project was inside my *Projects* directory, which is in my home directory, then I would follow the following steps,

```shell
cd ~/Projects/student-directory
ruby directory.rb
```
