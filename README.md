# Student Directory #

The Student Directory ruby script (directory.rb) enables the user to manage the list/directory of students that are currently enrolled at the Villains Academy :smiling_imp:.

## How to use ##

Once in the terminal, run the script by using the following ruby command,

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```

Make sure to be in the right directory before running the command. For instance, if the project was inside my *Projects* directory, which is in my home directory, then I would follow the following steps,

```shell
cd ~/Projects/student-directory
ruby directory.rb
```
